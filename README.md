I'm a student in Boston, majoring in computer science and electrical engineering (EECS) at MIT. My passion for technology has driven me to embark on a self-taught journey in software engineering, taking me from zero to where I am today. Along the way, I've worked on a variety of projects, from front-end to full-stack development, with a focus on AI, data systems, and software engineering. Exposure to both computer science and business practices has fueled my desire to continuously acquire new skills. I'm committed to hands-on learning and development, and my portfolio showcases coding projects that reflect my approach of starting from initial planning and design to solving complex problems.
